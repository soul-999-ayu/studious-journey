# Attendance-Register-Project-JAVA
This program can be used to develop a basic attendance register.

Note: 
* This project is solely created by AYUSH and you can use it as long as you don't consider it as yours.
* I cannot write the whole code in README.md, you can get all the classes from the files i uploaded.
* You can also download the JAR file of this project from the release section and import it to Eclipse of IntelliJ IDE.

Info:
This project is the base of a very big project which may replace the use of Attendance Register in classrooms. This project is in Beta version (0.5) and I'll update it time to time as will also maintain changelogs.

Features:
* Login required each time to mark or edit attendance.
* You need to create class which will be associated with a single account for the first time (1 Account = 1 Class)
* The main attendance page's ui is awesome and you can use the buttons to mark the attendance of students.
* You can edit the attendance based on the date.
* And many more.

Issues:
* The encryption of the accounts is not good and can be easly decrypted.
* The attendance file is locally stored in your hard disk so anyone can edit or delete it.
* The project has very less features as its in beta stage.

Future plans:
* I will improve encryption logic and will encrypt the class and attendance as well.
* I will implement edit class option in next version.
* I will try to store data on a server in next version.

Conclusion:
You can import it to your IDE and start implementing it or you can check the classes to get the basic idea of working of the program. Please consider checking my other repos too.
